Florida  Professor shows how | Mint" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>(The paper was updated on Sept 2023)</p><p><br>Researchers from the University of Florida have released a <a href="https://vincentlinsanity.github.io/woc-blog/can-ai-predict-stock-returns-study-from-cornell-researchers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">research</a> suggesting that the AI model ChatGPT can reliably predict stock market trends. Using public markets data and news from October 2021 to December 2022, their testing found that trading models powered by ChatGPT could generate returns exceeding 500% in this period. This performance stands in stark contrast to the -12% return from buying and holding an S&amp;P 500 ETF during the same timeframe. The study also underscored ChatGPT's superior performance over other language models, including GPT-1, GPT-2, and BERT, as well as traditional sentiment analysis methods.</p><p>Implications for the Financial Sector Prominent hedge funds like Two Sigma, DE Shaw, and Renaissance Technologies already integrate sentiment analysis into their trading algorithms. ChatGPT’s remarkable performance in interpreting news could ignite competition among funds eager to leverage Generative AI for an edge.</p><h3><strong>The Evolution of Language Models</strong></h3><h4><strong>Early Models: GPT-1, GPT-2, and BERT</strong></h4><p>The first generation of language models, like GPT-1, GPT-2, and BERT, showed promise but lacked the complexity needed for reliable stock prediction. They were decent at understanding text but lacked nuanced interpretation.</p><h4><strong>Introducing ChatGPT</strong></h4><p>Fast forward to ChatGPT. This model, powered by GPT-3.5, offers a more nuanced understanding of language, setting the stage for groundbreaking research in predicting stock market trends.</p><h3><strong>An Overview of the Study</strong></h3><h4><strong>Methodology</strong></h4><p>Exploring the Methodology The researchers adopted a robust backtesting approach to gauge the effectiveness of trading strategies driven by ChatGPT. They scrutinized a dataset of stock-focused headlines from October 2021 to December 2022, ensuring that none of the articles were in ChatGPT's training set.</p><h4><strong>Research Team and Dataset</strong></h4><p>By using web scraping methods, the team compiled 67,586 headlines related to 4,138 different companies. These headlines were then sorted for relevancy; only full articles and press releases were considered while eliminating any headlines specifically about stock gains or losses. Duplicate stories were also removed to maintain the novelty of the information used.</p><h3><strong>Diving into the Methodology</strong></h3><h4><strong>Web Scraping</strong></h4><p>The team used web scraping techniques to collect headlines, ensuring none of the data overlapped with ChatGPT’s training set.</p><h4><strong>Data Filtering</strong></h4><p>The headlines were filtered to exclude stock-gain or stock-loss headlines and remove duplicates.</p><h3><strong>Good News, Bad News, and Unknown</strong></h3><h4><strong>The Power of Nuanced Reasoning</strong></h4><p>The study employed a version of ChatGPT, specifically the one powered by GPT-3.5, to assess whether a headline signaled Good News, Bad News, or was neutral, along with brief justifications. For example, when faced with the headline, "Rimini Street Fined $630,000 in Case Against Oracle," ChatGPT provided an insightful analysis:. ChatGPT excels at discerning whether news is good, bad, or neutral, with detailed reasoning to back its classifications.</p><h3><strong>Strategies and Their Results</strong></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/fxksiu7yxym3/6ZDEyXUBwqzFDugKiPtPQn/0b4fd61b22e649fd48334efabc9365b8/Screen_Shot_2023-05-10_at_11.13.53_AM.png" data-is-external-image="true"></p><h4><strong>Long-Short Strategy</strong></h4><p>The Long-Short strategy (buying companies with good news and short-selling those with bad news) yielded more than a 500% return. Impressive, right?</p><h4><strong>Short-Only and Long-Only Strategies</strong></h4><p>The Short-only strategy(short-selling companies with bad news) returned nearly 400%, while the Long-only strategy returned roughly 50%.</p><h4><strong>Failed Strategies</strong></h4><p>Not all was rosy. Strategies like "All News" hold and Market Value-Weight hold resulted in net losses.</p><h3><strong>Benchmarking</strong></h3><h4><strong>Comparison with Traditional Methods</strong></h4><p>ChatGPT outshone traditional sentiment analysis methods, which often misinterpret the nuances in headlines.</p><h4><strong>Outperforming Other Language Models</strong></h4><p>Even older siblings like GPT-1 and GPT-2 couldn’t keep up. ChatGPT consistently outperformed them.</p><h3><strong>Implications for Hedge Funds</strong></h3><h4><strong>Established Firms</strong></h4><p>Two Sigma, DE Shaw, and Renaissance Technologies should take note. The landscape is shifting.</p><h4><strong>Boutique Hedge Funds</strong></h4><p>Smaller hedge funds also stand to gain a lot by adopting AI-driven models like ChatGPT.<br><br></p><h3><strong>A New Arms Race</strong></h3><p>Generative AI like ChatGPT could ignite a new arms race in the financial sector. It’s like unleashing a lion in a dog race!</p><h3><strong>Threats and Opportunities</strong></h3><p>Companies specializing in sentiment analysis could find themselves outpaced by newer, more potent AI models.</p><h3><strong>Retail Trading</strong></h3><p>Retail investors, too, could benefit from ChatGPT’s ability to read between the lines. Online communities like r/WallStreetBets, known for deep-dive analyses and boastful posts about stock gains, could potentially utilize ChatGPT to enhance their trading strategies. After all, who wouldn't want a 500% return on their investment?</p><h3><strong>Future Trends</strong></h3><p>ARK Investment Management's Cathie Wood envisions a dynamic financial landscape, dominated by AI.</p><h3><strong>The Skeptics</strong></h3><p>Of course, some skeptics question the reliability of using AI in trading. Yet, the numbers speak for themselves.</p><h3><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h3><p>In an ever-changing world, staying ahead of the curve is not just beneficial—it’s essential. And AI, especially models like ChatGPT, are game-changers.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>As the saying goes, numbers don't lie. The University of Florida's research on ChatGPT is just the tip of the iceberg. It offers an exciting glimpse into the future—a future where AI could very well dictate the ebbs and flows of the stock market. The future appears vibrant for the financial sector with generative AI taking the center stage. ARK Investment Management's Cathie Wood is particularly optimistic, as stated in her 2023 Big Ideas report, predicting that AI will significantly impact various industries and companies in the coming years.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 2, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fvincentlinsanity.github.io%2Fwoc-blog%2Fchatgpt-predict-stock-price-500-returns-from-researcher%2F" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://vincentlinsanity.github.io/woc-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://vincentlinsanity.github.io/woc-blog/authors/woc-street/" rel="author">WOC Street</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://vincentlinsanity.github.io/woc-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://vincentlinsanity.github.io/woc-blog/can-ai-predict-stock-returns-study-from-cornell-researchers/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Can AI Predict Stock Returns?
