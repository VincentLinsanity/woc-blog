Researchers at Cornell University have now found that such news can also play a vital role in fueling the algorithms for a cutting-edge financial prediction model.</p><p>In a study titled 'News-Based Sparse Machine Learning Models for Adaptive Asset Pricing,' published recently in the journal Data Science, the researchers amalgamate insights from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and finance. They have created an innovative machine learning framework that not only taps into stock and industry-specific data but also forecasts financial outcomes more accurately than traditional approaches.</p><p>Martin Wells, the senior author of the study and Charles A. Alexander Professor of Statistical Sciences at Cornell, pointed out that a common critique of machine learning is its lack of interpretability. 'In many cases, scholars applying these extensive models don't fully comprehend the meaning of the generated outputs or the internal mechanics of the model. Our study takes advantage of textual data from news sources to construct machine learning models that allow for explicit understanding of key features,' Wells said.</p><p>Liao Zhu, the paper’s lead author who transitioned into a finance industry role post-study, mentioned that their text analysis aids in 'data clustering.' This helps in organizing the otherwise messy outputs that algorithms often generate. 'We posit that financial news could be a more effective tool in comprehending the relationship between particular stocks and tradeable assets, like exchange-traded funds (ETFs),' Zhu explained.</p><p>This study builds upon Zhu's earlier research and incorporates contributions from other scholars like Robert Jarrow and Peter (Haoxuan) Wu. While traditional statistical methods and sentiment analysis from text data have long been used for market predictions, this new research is groundbreaking. It proposes a fluid prediction model that marries both market and text data without relying solely on sentiment analysis.</p><p>Instead of using sentiments from news, the researchers employ an algorithm that uses news text as a reference point to determine what assets or terms should be considered for each particular stock or industry. 'Our approach offers more targeted and industry-specific insights,' noted Zhu.</p><p>To hone their models, the researchers ingested an extensive range of online financial news articles spanning from 2013 to 2019. They then employed algorithms to map out specific assets and terms linked to particular stocks and industries. Two distinct models emerged: the News Embedding UMAP Sparse Selection (NEUSS) model focuses on individual stock returns, while the News Sparse Encoder with Rationale (INSER) model zeroes in on industry-specific terminologies to make more accurate industry return predictions.</p><p>For instance, NEUSS might infer that an ETF tracking the semiconductor sector is crucial for forecasting the returns of a tech company, but not for a company in the retail sector. Similarly, INSER might identify the term 'plant' as important within the energy sector but irrelevant for others like social media.</p><p>Their approach proved successful. NEUSS outperformed the standard Fama-French 5-factor model by a margin of 50%, while INSER exceeded its benchmark by 10%, even without incorporating industry-specific data.</p><p>Zhu and Wells both agree that the marriage of machine learning and various data types is transforming the landscape of financial analysis. 'The AI-driven transformation in finance is already a reality,' said Zhu, 'and our study serves as a stepping stone in this ongoing revolution.'"</p><p><br><br>FAQs<br><br>1. What makes the Cornell research different from traditional financial models?<br>  - The study uses machine learning and news data to create more accurate and interpretable financial prediction models.<br><br>2. What is NEUSS?<br>  - It's a model developed in the study that focuses on predicting individual stock returns.<br><br>3. What is INSER?<br>  - INSER is another model from the study that focuses on industry-specific returns.<br><br>4. How do these models improve interpretability?<br>  - They leverage news data to make it easier to understand why a stock or an industry might perform a certain way.<br><br>5. Are these models available for public use?<br>  - The study is academic, and it's unclear when or if these models will be available for the general public.<br><br><br></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 2, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fvincentlinsanity.github.io%2Fwoc-blog%2Fcan-ai-predict-stock-returns-study-from-cornell-researchers%2F" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://vincentlinsanity.github.io/woc-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://vincentlinsanity.github.io/woc-blog/authors/woc-street/" rel="author">WOC Street</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://vincentlinsanity.github.io/woc-blog/chatgpt-predict-stock-price-500-returns-from-researcher/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> ChatGPT Predict Stock Price - 500% Returns from Researcher </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://vincentlinsanity.github.io/woc-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-10-02T18:51" class="feed__date">October 2, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://vincentlinsanity.github.io/woc-blog/chatgpt-predict-stock-price-500-returns-from-researcher/">ChatGPT Predict Stock Price - 500% Returns from Researcher</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://vincentlinsanity.github.io/woc-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://vincentlinsanity.github.io/woc-blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
